Banks and financial institutions allocate substantial resources towards attracting and engaging clients to open term deposits with their institution. A successful marketing campaign not only adds value to customers but also fosters robust relationships that drive more business. An effective marketing strategy can generate positive word-of-mouth publicity and facilitate expansion into new markets.

Designing a successful marketing campaign involves several considerations, such as pricing, target demographics, and distribution channels. The Analysis and Design System (ADS) discussed here focuses on analyzing historical marketing campaign data from a Portuguese financial institution. The goal is to discern the driving factors behind a successful marketing strategy that encourages clients to open term deposits. The ADS delves into a comprehensive analysis of various attributes within the dataset, conducts exploratory data analysis, preprocesses the data, and employs diverse classifiers to attain optimal results.

Sensitive attributes within the dataset, such as age, education, and marital status, play a critical role in shaping the marketing strategies. Financial institutions often tailor their offerings based on perceived profitability, which may inadvertently lead to excluding potential clients deemed as credit risks or financially vulnerable. Biases stemming from these factors can impact both the marketing strategies and relationships with existing clients, potentially alienating certain groups.

To ensure a fair and equitable ADS, it is imperative to assess its performance across different subgroups, including distinct age groups and marital statuses. By doing so, the ADS can address biases, offer inclusivity, and foster trust among clients.
